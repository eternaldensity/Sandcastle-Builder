## 3.185
- I can't even rename a variable without messing up, sorry waveney
- messed around with some boost unlock conditions
- new badge

## 3.184

- Track buy/sell of tools
- Track upgrade/downgrade boosts
- Free Advice tells you how to get Sand/Castles to Glass, once you get Tool Factory
- Renamed anything with threshhold to threshold
- Shoutout to bay12forums: Just noticed some active visitors from there. I like to read stuff there on occasion (Battlefailed Saga!)
- Line on AA description about how it stops glass-gain messages since that would be spammy otherwise
- Removed Double or Nothing forever
- waveney's thing for supressing tiny glass notifications (changed to use a variable rather than literals, so it's easier to tweak if necessary)
- Didn't upgrade the PC upgrade limit because I don't want to.

## 3.183
- Making the Discoveries category use the appropriate icon slipped my mind, again
- Missing icon
- Inverted statements
- Recycling Beanies hint if you don't have enough BBs

## 3.182
- Typo fixes from waveney (SGR, MMolpy)
- Badge by waveney
- Got lost reading TVTropes, sorry. Guess I better push these bugfixes, but first:
- When you have Panther Glaze, the descriptions of the boosts it modified show how many glass chips they produce

## 3.181
- Factory Automation description changed to stop people asking how to upgrade it again after they temporal rift :P
- Fixed some transparency stupidity (btw yes if there's a lot of notifications on the screen, some will not go transparent at all until the others have vanished)
- Added an explanatory note to Bag Burning so people don't think it's broken and "fix" it with the console. *ahem*

## 3.18
- Lots more icons from BlitzGirl
- Temporal Rift fixed for infinite castles, like Molpy Down
- New Ninja boost
- Nerfed Fireproof a bit
- Some Not Lucky boost description changes (regarding not costing glass if you have infinite castles)
- Read TVTropes a lot
- Glass Tools now show glass stats instead of sand/castle stats when appropriate
- When building 0 castles, a castle multiplier of infinity (from flux surge?) will now result in 0 rather than mustard (NaN)

## 3.17
- Messed with chance of intruder bots in a certain circumstance...
- When loading, if highest NP visited is missing, using the current NewPix number
- When you have Bacon, Bag Burning is locked if you pass its threshold, so millions of bags are not continually burned pointlessly forever
- A boost for NewPixBots, related to the above item.
- If a spendable value gets to negative (i.e. number of glass blocks), you can now still buy stuff that costs 0 of that.
- This particularly fixes weirdness such as ASHF landing in the shop rather than in loot (because they still count as being bought for 0 because reasons)
- Fixed Furnace Multitasking description (thanks for pointing that out eldercain)
- Fixed a Logicat power bug in Dragon Forge (I can hardly believe I wrote that sentence and it means something)
- Finished the other new dragon
- Added some redundancy (it's been a while)

## 3.16
- New Boost Icons from BlitzGirl! (mostly tagged boosts)
- Zero more potential mustard (NaN) when loading
- Beachball Boost doesn't show ninja warning after you've ninja'd
- Redunception doesn't notify if Expando is active
- Automata Control optimised when you have all glass tools: no need to make tools that are about to be spent
- Sand particles don't need transparency
- Don't mess with transparancy of more than 8 notifications
- Fixed a discovery on wrong NP
- When you Molpy Down with infinite castles, totalCastlesDown is set to Number.MAX_VALUE (previously it was unchanged if infinite castles) thanks EPSILON of DashNet IRC
- Chromatic Heresy is related to 'hue', right? ;)
- Formatting of negative decimal numbers was horribly broken. Not that there should be negative numbers, but now if there is, they're the right negative numbers!
- Remove spaces from tool icon IDs
- New Tool Icons also from BlitzGirl! Yay!!
- Constructing from Blackprints now does nothing if you somehow end up with less pages then needed
- Two new Tool boosts. (What is Friendship? Why does the hotdog not have any wolpeys?)
- Another Dragon, plus one not finished yet

## 3.153
- Discovery Detector messages go to log
- Typo in Discovery Detector (yay not mine)
- I forgot to wrap the Sand Monument images in the new URL function I'd extracted when attempting to do preloading
- So now Sand Monument images will actually appear
- Another DD change by waveney
- Stats shows partial blackprints, also by waveney (wish I'd thought of that! Well I hope I would have, but it's a moot point question now :P)
- Forgot to change a number when I supposedly made Mysterious Representations activate at lower AC levels, making it go backwards
- I updated Google Chrome and now I can't look at the console and sources at the same time. (Just felt like complaining)
- Panther Rush checks that you have the required logicat levels when buying it
- Panther Rush asks the user if you really want to spend the logicat levels before using them
- Panther Rush reunlocks after usage if you have enough Logicat levels for its next (or current, if you declined to buy it) level
- That's because the confirmation actually happens after buying so it has to lock and unlock to ensure the number of boosts owned comes out right
- Assuming it does come out right (let me know if you see any wonky numbers: someone reported an issue with negative boosts owned a while back and though I haven't bene able to reproduce it, that doesn't mean it can't happen in some circumstances)
- Rambled in changelog. I'm surprised I managed to avoid doing that for so long. I tend to ramble. Especially when... nevermind

## 3.152
- Allowed much higher production control

## 3.151
- Missed buckets in my phone-only mustard sand-tool-rate fix, which cost me a factory automation run because I had no sand unexpectedly

## 3.15
- Bunch of numbers in the save were being parsed as ints instead of floats, leading to problems now that the numbers are large enough
- In particular, glass storage sizes, but temporal duplicates were now able to go wrong too, and the number of active bots, and a few other things
- Thanks for doing that for me waveney :D

## 3.143
- Okay so the problem was that on my phone, javascript likes to think that Math.pow() should return 0 instead of Infinity for very large exponents
- And it was fine for castle tools since I was shortcutting their prices to infinity already. So now I'm doing that for sand tools also

## 3.142
- Messing with order of multiplication of sand tool rate multipliers, returning early for infinities, might fix the NaNs that only show up on my phone

## 3.1416
- Handle weird case where Constructing from Blackprints is constructing nothing (I don't even)
- Locked Crate reward no longer uses a loop to expand block storage. That was stupid
- Negative message on Discovery Detector (thanks waveney)
- New dragon
- Finally remembered to put jQuery.js back on the index page

## 3.1415
- Disabled the jQuery preload of next newpix because it was not working and was spitting out errors for some
- faster seaish (big) upgrades of Sand Purifier and Glass Extruder (waveney)
- Redundatracking, and some tracking bugfixes
- Beachball boost fix: ensure change to blue is after bots have activated
- Sawtracking

## 3.141
- Tracking update: convert integers to strings
- Less hovering

## 3.14
- Automata Control next upgrade price shown
- Strikethrough on unaffordable stuff
- Waveney's discovery detector
- Finally fixed tool price formatting so that NewPixBot costs 1 Castle not 1 Castles
- Prices are divs not spans so they don't start on the same line as the buy link
- Some Google Analytics stuff
- Achronal Dragon to track and destroy temporal duplicates (if you want to)
- Add/Spend Glass Chips now makes the following descriptions update (per mNP): Glass Chip Storage, Sand Refinery, Glass Extruder
- Add/Spend Glass Blocks now makes the following descriptions update (per mNP): Glass Block Storage, Sand Purifier, Glass Chiller
- Cold Mould boost to pause Mould activities
- Price Protection boost to prevent accidental buys after ASHF ends (is togglable)
- Added a bunch of tool chip rate badges
- Preloading the next newpix 2mNP before the ONG (except it isn't working yet, I think)
- Changed Beachball boost to warn 2mNP before ONG rather than 1 (because of the above)

## 3.13
- Now you can call Molpify like this: Molpify(someNumber, decimalPlaces,2) and it won't apply all the letter prefix things, regardless of your game's scientific notation setting
- The 'enough chips for making blocks' check was backwards all along
- Changed Broken Rung condition: for instance while 6000 bags bought will make LaPetite visible (unchanged), 6000 bags *owned* is needed for 0 LaPetite to affect Broken Rung
- New Badge for beginners to teach about waiting for the ONG
- Also extended the description of Castle Price Rollback badge
- Added google analytics to track pageviews.  Let me know if that is a terrible idea
- BKJ power level moved to display on stats rather than description
- Also improved BFJ description/stats a bit
- Nerfed Blast Furnace a little pre-BFJ (was limited to total castles built /2, now it's /3) but buffed it with BFJ (was /10, now /5)
- So Blast Furnace with BFJ (and Blitzing) is still more limited by the total castles built than otherwise, but if your total castles built is huge then it's better than without (i.e if you've used Molpy Down you can potentially catch back up faster)
- Blast Furnace with Blitzing without BFJ is twice as effective as without Blitzing, which is unchanged from before but I just thought I'd mention it.
- Fixed Tool Factory giving things it shouldn't: I forgot to copy a condition

## 3.12
- I removed the molpies and grapevines from the wrong place
- The previous Tool Factory changes broke Tool Factory (and all your tools) if you didn't have Tool Factory
- If you don't have an earlier save, sorry but your tools are gone and I can't get them back. If you remember how many you had, feel free to edit them back in
- Also suggest suitable punishments for me
- So yeah I should test what happens if you *don't* have features that I'm changing as well as if you do.

## 3.11
- Panther Rush description missing word
- Ensure WWB/RB's unlock Boosts will unlock if you're already eligible for them.
- Don't show trade/hint for WWB when infinite factor
- Remove WWB from tagged items when infinite factor
- Adjust Knitted Beanies and Space Elevator prices
- Wasn't a way to see BKJ! power level
- Locking glass ceilings now distributes Tool Factory's production over the remaining glass tools
- i.e. if you have PC=1 and lock 6 of 12 glass ceilings, it'll make 2 of the remaining 6 tools per mNP (assuming you can afford it!)
- or if you lock 11 you'll get 12x the 1 you didn't lock
- Upgrading to new version now says 'upgrading to new version instead of:
- *Molpy, molpy, molpy, molpy*
- *Molpy, molpy, molpy, molpy*
- *Molpy, molpy, molpy, molpy*
- *Grapevine, grapevine*
- More PC multiupgrades: now in a for loop!
- Changed Tool Factory (other than the simple can afford to buy everything case) to bulk buy the largest number of tools it can buy the same amount of, then buy 1 of anything leftover
- Bag burning should power up twice as fast, also removed the random burning of single bags.
- Longer description for Bag Burning
- Some Tool rate badges
- DestroyPhase function no longer loops once per castle tool owned (which is kinda slow when you get millions), instead uses division :P
- A single over nine thousand joke wasn't enough. Especially since I made it months ago.

## 3.1
- Fixed index to accept title change
- Panther Rush description improved so players don't expect to see it in their Loot
- Fixed castle display so it shows "1 castle" for that first castle rather than "1 castles"
- Molpify Ninja Stealth Build amount
- Truncate scientific notation numbers to 6 decimal places
- Boots typo
- Coloured border was not removed when loading a save with Beachball boost disabled
- Fixed another Beach CSS problem: turned out all the recent issues there were caused by using .background instead of .backgroundImage
- A couple new Glass Tool boosts

## 3.09
- If Locked Crate prices is mustarded, it becomes free (apart from the glass). Sorry I thought that couldn't happen in the wild.
- And a Badge because why not?
- More of Waveney's Discoveries
- Removed all the upgrade code for versions less than 2.1 because I doubt anyone is running those. If so, let me know and don't upgrade until I put it back.
- Showing full numbers in scientific notation instead of the shortened numbers is now a separate option rather than based on being in stats view
- Toggling Stats wasn't redrawing Badges
- Added Mushrooms as a counterpart to Badgers

## 3.08
- Mys*t*erious typo fixed
- Unneeded Factory Automation Upgraded message removed from Ninja Climber
- Mysterious Representations now works from AC level 15 (Zookeeper still works from 21), updated descriptions accordingly
- Blast Furnace doesn't do any blastfurnacing if you have infinite castles (doesn't effect crossfeed/multitasking)
- Keygrinder's check for key availability now doesn't need to have a logicat reward to have run first
- Spent a while reading some /vg/ igg threads which showed up when I googled VITSSÅGEN. Very amuse!
- Found a bunch of stuff that needs fixing, thanks /vg/ (lulz typo, I just saw someone pointing that out... sigh)
- Noticed that VITSSÅGEN, JA!'s description didn't mention that it gives castles every 100 clicks, since that was originally a totally unimportant fringe benefit
- VJ and Panther Salve also didn't mention that they unlock other boosts with use.
- Phonesaw also didn't say what it does, added that to its stats.
- Fixed 'activation level': meant 'automation level', duh.
- Clear target answer after completing a logicat question
- 50 Glass Block cost for Second Chance is not applied until you click the second answer
- Instructions on how to use your leopard
- Prevent Tool Factory Load Letter (and subsequent) if you don't have Tool Factory
- Added Bacon to Blackprints build list for people who managed to get infinite sand rate without it and don't want to wait (yes I wrote dip before, that was wrong)
- Bigger load sizes for TFLL
- With Booster Glass, show +numbers on click (if the click-numbers option is enabled)
- Fixed stupid CSS weirdness preventing the resizing of Colpix

## 3.07
- Moved AdjustFade so it's accessible to the index page (so the version number shows up again)
- Changed Locksmith to Mysterious Representations, which produces pages directly.
- Removed Zookeeper notification (just wait for Caged Logicat to show up)
- Track redundakitty chains, added a badge and a stat
- Actually fixed Overcompensating
- If Panther Rush is stuck in Loot from earlier bug, run its buy function to fix

## 3.06
- On buying a Crate Key, it will try to buy Locked Crate before using up the key making the Crate cheaper (so the key will be used to remove a lock, when it previously it was wasted)
- Added stats view for Trebuchet Pong, Grapevine, Ch*rpies, and Facebugs
- Beachball
- Exponential boosts now say "boosts by x% cumulatively per thing" to distinguish them from linear increases
- Wasn't Molpifying the division numbers for sand purifier or glass extruder

## 3.05
- Fixed Expando/Glass Monument interaction

## 3.04
- Prevent Locksmith from awarding ASHF when you already have it
- Overcompensating's buff wasn't applied to saves which already had Overcompensating owned
- Fix panther rush on-buy crash (fortunately it was in calculating the levels so it didn't waste any levels)
- Nerfed Locksmith a bit (even though it wasn't any more powerful than AA was previously if you knew how to leverage it...)
- Crate key message improved and not shown if from locksmith
- Boost unlock/lock/describe messages supressed from locksmith/zookeeper: just 1 message to show that one/both activated
- Disabled Expando because it's causing problems and I don't have time to fix it properly right now, sorry
- Glass Saw is a toggle now
- Molpy Down refreshes the Options

## 3.03
- Changed all occurrences of "% of sand dug" to "% of sand dig rate", so glass-production costs are clearer (thanks Vidyogamasta for pointing that out... 2 weeks ago)
- Waveney's improvement to Glass Saw: instead of leaving 5% of Block Storage empty, it leaves space equal to 10mNP worth of Automata Assemble's Factory Automation (so it'll still fill block storage if you don't have AA going)
- Automata Assemble now uses same function for running FA in all cases
- Automata Assemble description updated to show that it only activates Blast Furnace (and subsequent functions based on crossfeed/multitasking)
- New boosts to add ability for AA to do Blackprints/Moulds work, and produce Keys and Panther Poke
- Monument Time Travel doesn't use any castles now but it costs more chips. (based on the square of the distance, so multiple short hops are cheaper than a long jump)
- Destruction verb for NewPixBots because their destruction counter is used in Judgement Dip
- Furnace Multitasking was not locking in shortpix, which lead to weirdness with AA because it quickly used up all your (well, my) Chips making Blocks
- Sand Monuments show a thumbnail of their NP and Glass Monuments change the main image to their image
- SGC added. No that does not stand for Seaish Glass Chips
- Seaish Glass Chips description improved to explain what it doesn't do
- A couple of monument related boosts (untested...)
- Seaish upgrade for Glass Chiller is limited so it won't use more chips than the Glass Furnace is making
- *The Sea is Big*

## 3.021
- Was missing a return so the castle tool price calc was still horribly slow

## 3.02
- Added Upgrade x10 button to Production Control
- Downgrade buttons on Production Control, Automata Control, Sand Refinery, and Glass Chiller are all hidden by No Sell
- But did anyone ever use those apart from accidentally?
- Fix stupid typo (pricePrice) which was messing up the shortcut calculation of infinte castle tool prices and therefore causing higher load times the more castle tools you/I have
- If no Blackprint-construction remains, the Blackprints-needed stat shows the amount needed for Automata Control
- Panther Rush now uses up 5 less Logicat levels, but still unlocks at the same point, meaning when you buy it you can't have less than 5 levels left

## 3.01
- Shopping donkey doesn't buy if no item (i.e. prevent crash.)
- Logicat's "correct answers needed" display now accounts for Panther Rush
- Bunch of new NP-based badges, by waveney (cos I was taking too long getting around to adding them)
- Fixxed some typoes
- Safety Goggles prevents Safety Hat unlock
- Glass Saw doesn't competely fill glass block storage (another waveney idea)
- Pluralisation (i.e. conditional 's') finally moved to a function. Please report any resulting/remaining pluralisation errors. Once. ;)
- CMS description clarified (I hope) a little.
- Added a new link to the index: something which I only just discovered exists :P

- Stat for chips per click
- Clean up mustarded totalcastlesbuilt for castletools
- Changed Panther Rush to increase the points from Logicats (Caged and Wild) instead of the number of Caged questions available
- It's half a point per level which means it's about as powerful before : at level 1, 10 answers is worth 15 answers and at level 2, 10 answers is worth 20. (it used to give 5 extra questions per level)
- Split DoRD/Logicat reward logic into two separate functions

- Automata Assemble lets you upgrade glass storage any time.
- Control Automata price reflects the description
- Earning a Badge when you have Badgers recalculates sand dig rate
- DeMolpify function now handles empty string or undefined value (returns 0) which should prevent stack overflow

## 2.94

- block gain/loss messages were not consistent with chips
- Performance increase if you have all Glass Tools enabled for Tool Factory and can afford them
- Redraw stuff when hiding Stats
- Fiddled with Glass Saw a bit
- Safety stuff

## 2.93
- Shopping Assistant remembers your choice. (BTW it doesn't work for Bigger Buckets. But you probably already have that)
- I think I fixed the issue of free boosts not being bought on occasion: castles were NaN after spending infinite castles

- Removed the 'of 1 needed' from sand display when castles are infinite
- Castle tool prices are always recalculated from scratch rather than subtracting previous price from current because the rounding errors are too much for reliability
- Prices that are definitely going to be infinite (i.e. over 1500 of a castle tool) are not calculated, just assumed to be infinite without calculating

## 2.892
- Made it possible to get Flux Capacitor if time travel costs more castles than you have
- Fixed logic for use of glass ceiling badges: they were being checked as if they were boosts
- Fixed description of factory automation: wasn't showing correct prices

- Demustard sandDug and sandManual
- Tiny nerf to LaPetite again
- BBC wasn't causing recalculate of dig rates on toggle
- Game and per-tool glass totals are now saved. (this is quite separate to glass chip storage)
- JDip countdown is sanitized to 0 if not a number, or negative
- Tweaked the maximum JDip algorithm a bit

## 2.87

- Made a way to unlock Castles to Glass
- Clarified descriptions of Sand to Glass and Castles to Glass a little
- Buffed Overcompensating because reasons
- Undid yesterday's nerf to Temporal Duplication

- Fiddled with JDip levels and destruction amounts a bunch. A lot actually.
- Yeah I didn't get time to do other important stuff because I spent so long on JDip

## 2.83
- Maybe there will never be a version 28. Maybe glass ceilings shouldn't lock on every load until then.

## 2.81
- Now using more c**kies to save

## 2.8

## 2.62

## 2.33
- Uh, how did that = get in there?

## 2.32
- Ensure Time Travel's power is 1 on buy (that was for a feature I never ended up making, whereby you could power up Time Travel to make bigger jumps. Now there's a better way of doing that.)
- Upgrade for person who has bought Time Travel and is stuck with it on power 0
- Apology

## 2.31
- Fixed erroneous save failed messages
- Factory Ninja is buffed based on logicat level

## 2.3

- I'll test those some other time and maybe remove them if they aren't needed

- Fixed RRR parentheses mustard
- 2 new Not Lucky boosts... which are pretty powerful but probably not enough for waveney
- Judgement Dip/Report are now not Alert by default, because if they are inactive they switch off after a mNP anyway, and now that you can save your Show/Hide state, it's annoying to see them appear and vanish on load
- Another Not Lucky boost and buffed the previous 2
- Now they're probably overpowered. I dunno. I'm 2 nopix late for coma.

- Two wrong logicat answers are worth minus one correct answer now, so it's a little easier to level logicat.
- Sometimes logicat statements are longer.

### 1.83
- Fixed Glass Ceiling glass prices: they were all the same when they should not have been.
- Earning Ceiling Broken makes all the ceilings untagged, and you can lock any of them if you like, and they're all available from the Department if you do lock them, and the prices go back to their base values permanently. (Or for instance if you Molpy Down)
- Removed floor pie and ceiling pie from the code so I can actually read it.
- Fiddled with redacted timing, should work more consistently now

- When building or destroying castles, if the amount is less than 1/10000 of the castles you have, don't notify (the amount is added to the running total of castles to notify about later)
- Prevent "by the newpixbots" message from showing if the amount destroyed was not shown.

- Fixed import of totalCastlesDown - was parsing int rather than float so if you got too high it would truncate to single digit :P

- Furnace Crossfeed toggle
- looked at the grammar of *its* description and realised that *it's* wrong.
