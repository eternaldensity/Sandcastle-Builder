- LucidCrux: grey versions icons for boosts in shop!! wow! (also some fancy CSS stuff I need to learn)
- mart0258: Flipside fix
- Something new in the Index. It's boring.

### 3.3
- Some description improvements

- Stuff section is now dynamically generated from all Stuff boosts that exist (thanks LucidCrux!)
- Void Goat fix - waveney
- Furnace/Blower fix - waveney
- More Time Lord info - waveney
- Rob Refresh fix = waveney
- Archimedes only spends bonemeal if he finds a mould to start
- Restored colouring on upgradable badges (e.g. a Discovery you don't have the Sand Monument of will be yellow)
- Fixed a discovery typo which waveney made :P
- Missing tool refresh in toolfactory

### 3.2994
- Badges can be faves!
- In stats view the alias of boosts and badges is shown. This can be used to refer to it in Shopping Assistant or Faves instead of the full name.
- Time Lord shows remaining jumps (thanks ddrdude/eqbot)

### 3.2993
- Unbroke Vacuum unlock (accidentally replaced the refreshFunction). This hadn't affected functionality except that your vacuum count wasn't visible if you didn't already have vacuum
- Missing parentheses in Panther Rush were making it lock when it shouldn't.
- Notification when a Key tries to buy a Crate/Vault and fails (to prevent empty logicat message)
- Panther Rush was unlocking regardless of blackprints and vacuum.
- Faves refresh on Load and when you make them Visible

### 3.2992
- Vacuum wasn't using Flux Crystals

### 3.2991
- Fix Panther Rush Logicat Level calculation
- tag QQ
- Toggles for Void Starer and Void Vault
- Prevent Ladder sand/mNP mustard
- Why is glass/click worked out twice? That'll need sorting out some time. Anyhow, Bone Clicker now actually really works
- Un-unerfed Void Starer a bit
- Added a new boost which sucks
- Between the Cracks is now a toggle, also it works on checking if you have sand/castles rather than just when buying sand/castles. So now it bypasses Fireproof and Vacuum Cleaner
- waveney's new boost to make obtaining flux crystals easier

### 3.299
- String-based prices were not working right in most cases.
- Vacuum Cleaner was activating at the wrong time so it wasn't letting you get Blitzing from logicats
- Lightning Strikes Twice wasn't refreshing GL or TDE
- Beachball boost adds a purple border for Temporal Rift
- Rosetta now refreshes when you click Start Construction (so having her as a Fave should work)
- Buying a glass boost from Rosetta should now Refresh her also

### 3.298
- Nerf flux crystal-> vacuum some more (also now it needs Qubes because why not?)
- Major nerf to Void Starer (didn't think that through :P)
- Logarithmic price increase for Time Lord upgrades
- Panther Rush price increased now that logicat pays out higher
- Higher Panther Rush has some exotic costs
- I'm feeling super generous so now comic-clicks activate shopping assistant.
- Zookeper implementation made more efficient
- Increased costs of Bags of Something (specifically blackprints)
- Boost to make Vaults relevant again
- If a Blast Furnace run is given out as a fallback reward, a notification is provided (because otherwise it can look like an empty Logicat reward)
- Bag of Jolting was broken all along
- Eww effect didn't match description

### 3.297
- Fix for Vacuum Cleaner unlock so it's available if you already have Magic Mirror
- Button to clear Logicat guesses if you want to start over
- Blackprints' description has a little more info
- Claim inversion is remembered (i.e. the 'not' in puzzles is only randomised once so it doesn't keep changing)
- Nerfed Flux Crystals->Vacuum exchange rate

### 3.296
- Zookeeper description points out the benefit of having over 1K AA runs available for it
- Did something interesting for large numbers of logicat rewards.
- Prevent message spam from Shopping Assistant item (e.g. keys) and prevent switching to the tab of auto-bought items (e.g. crates)
- Magic Mirror unlock fix was actually broken and crashing
- Made Vacuum Cleaner more expensive
- Active puzzle prevents Caged Logicat untagged

### 3.295
- Expando fixed for tools and boosts in shop

### 3.294
- GoatONG was a bit too powerful due to the 'locking it gives 2 prizes which could include itself especially if you savescum' effect.
- Redrawing the boosts (for various occasional reasons) removes the descriptions but it wasn't informing the boosts of this so they weren't redrawing them. (Yeah I should just change it to draw the descriptions when drawing the shop in the first place)

### 3.293
- Mucked around with how hover/refresh work to prevent extra redrawing of Caged Logicat
- Lightning Strikes Twice was (accidentally) capping the Glassed Lightning power to 500!
- Single Caged Logicat puzzle now gives you points (oops) also on answering a puzzle you are shown the number of points awarded.
- Logicat report (correct/incorrect/points) is notified before the rewards (thought it still breaks if you have a LOT of rewards, I'll deal with that later)
- Second Chance not offered if you only answer one question

### 3.292
- Seaish boosts only take 500 purifier/extruder level rather than 1000
- Now Where Was I boost by waveney
- Fix to Rob for Classic by waveney
- Logicat puzzle deducted as soon as you pay for one (so it can't also be used for Shadow Dragon): also waveney
- Castle Tool text clarified (waveney started it but I redid it my way)
- Fast Forward was utterly broken (took you to newpix NaN)
- Getting prizes from locking prizes wasn't taking into account that you might already have some prizes
- Bag of Holding nerfed to only hold 1W of each kind of Stuff. Having additional Bags of Something multiplies this by 1W for each.
- Shadow Dragon shows greedy/generous in bonemeal reward message
- Ninja Lockdown prevents Impervious Ninja from being given when enabled
- Factory Automation costs are not increased if you don't have AA (important for Bag of Moulding)
- WotA stats has more text.
- Magic Mirror is now unlocked when you activate the Camera if you currently have 10 or more Minus Discoveries (rather than keeping a counter of how many minus discoveries have been made)
- Hall of Mirrors mentions change to MHP cost
- Major Logicat Puzzle change: puzzles are guaranteed solvable, you can answer any number of questions you like (including none) and are rewarded based on the difference between the number of correct and incorrect answers.
- Lower reward and higher penalty on the second chance. Second chance is offered if you have at least 1 incorrect answer, but is optional (you are informed how many are incorrect)
- New option of combining some multiple of 10 puzzles together to save time (e.g. if you have 51 to 60 puzzles available you may pay for 50 puzzles answer a puzzle, and get 50 times the reward or penalty)
- Puzzles are possibly a little less interesting though: statements are made up of less parts (1 or sometimes 2, but no triples. I'll probably work on that, and add 'implies' at some point.)
- Unlock Buzz Saw if you already have infinite glass
- Added a way to avoid infinite sand (to allow blizting) when you have an infinite sand dig rate)
- Lightning Strikes Twice used to boost the power of Glassed Lightning but I changed it to boost the countdown a while ago. Now it does *both*
- Added a use for vacuum: getting more blackprints
- Recycling Beanies wasn't refreshing on upgrade.
- Glass Saw didn't refresh on use
- Prevent Zookeeper from refreshing Caged Logicat while it is displaying a puzzle
- Buffed Glass Saw a lot
- Notification about awarding Temporal Duplication wasn't accounting for owning Temporal Duplication because it was bought *after* it was described
- Changed Dragon Forge rounding so you'll get a minimum 0.04x rather than 0x duplication multiplier without a charged Lightning Rod

### 3.291
- The Autoscroll option was not added to Classic
- Changed Autoscroll option to say "Autoscroll Log"
- Price Protection logic was wrong for boosts

### 3.29
- Fix shopping assistant for tools
- Some Prizes
- A little work on DQ but won't be ready for quite a while
- Dragon Forge wasn't refreshed when upgrading with it
- Unlock Buzz Saw if you have infinite glass storage space
- Some changes to help prevent being stuck showing the wrong NewPix (from Glass Monuments) which in some cases was causing stuff to be flipped (for Minus) when it oughtn't be
- Made Time Lord more expensive due to complaints about it being too useful or something
- Log Autoscroll by AmauryLepicard, with option

### 3.289
- Reduced Ninja Herder requirement (shouldn't have been so high)
- Reduced Panther Rush cost (it's linear now rather than exponential)
- Buzz Saw to make your Glass Sawing easier (well, mine. because I'm bored of it)

### 3.288
- Added a little info to GL stats
- Handle Meteorpix
- Plural Flux Crystals in description
- Blackprints have a cost so they aren't treated as a temp boost (which caused the first map to become mustard instead)
- Negative map targets now persist
- New prizes
- Fixed some accidental references to Temporal Duplication which should have been TDE

### 3.287
- More Time Lord fix: it's now a boost that you can level up to do more jumping per ONG!
- Ninja Lockdown is now styled as a Toggle because it is.
- Another boost to help get goats and a related badge

### 3.286
- negative tools were causing infinite loops on factory automation and price calculation
- on loading prevent negative tools also

### 3.285
- This fixes crate keys. Because of weird reasons.

### 3.2842
- Fix Caged Logicat purchase

### 3.2841
- Finally fixed the old problem of showing the loot section of boosts which were bought and immediately locked

### 3.284
- Zookeeper was broken

### 3.283
- So basically I forgot to change the DoRD and Logicat rewards to check whether boosts cost anything using the new pricing system.
- Also some prices were manually set using the old system (navcode and ceilings 10 and 11)

### 3.282
- glassfix

### 3.281
- Some prices went missing
- GoatONG wasn't working
- That's all I have time to fix right now :(

### 3.28
- waveney fixed glass storage (which he also broke)
- I hadn't quite fixed shopping assistant for aliased boosts.
- Redid boost pricing! Fortunately I'd already done half the work with prize level costs
- Prices show stuff in the correct order (it was "stuff number and" rather than "and number stuff" :P (though I switched to + rather than and)
- Added a way to get goats: by ninjaing!
- Prevent MHP buttons from getting into the log
- TFLL's unlock condition removed but now it costs TF chips (yay new pricing system!)
- Prizes give prizes when locked (i.e. using singleuse prizes!)

### 3.278
- Refresh WWB
- Now you can Break the Mould from a Mould Maker even when construction is finished, in case things get weirdly stuck.
- Fixed some Molpy Down bugs
- Price protection purchase *always* crashed

### 3.2771
- Unbroke Achronal Dragon (oops that was a simple silly mistake which I should have spotted but didn't test because it was 'so simple' :(

### 3.277
- Prevent Time Lord
- Some waveney Rob fixes
- Technicolour Dream Cat now has a wider-reaching effect

### 3.276
- Finally got Panther Rush to behave itself. Also messed around with costs a bit.
- Mucked around with how Prizes work: the tiers are clearly separated and you need to get a new Bag to progress from tier to tier.

### 3.275
- Switching Glass Furnace broke the Molpy.IsEnabled function
- Made Panther Rush cheaper for faster logicat progression
- some refinery/chiller description cleanup
- Logicat level is formatted in Logicat description
- Changed the way maps work: you need 300 glass monuments to get the first map, and 5 more glass monuments to decypher each subsequent map. So you'll still end up needing most of the current available glass monuments to get 100 maps but you can start getting maps a lot sooner and then push forward NewPix to get at more maps.
- Some new prizes
- Mustard Sale unlock condition was still wrong
- Prize section visiblity wasn't being saved

### 3.274
- Break the Mould unlocks quicker: it wasn't counting the amount of factory automation you had and was just counting a fail once per machine per run.
- Countdowns are loaded as a float rather than an int (why didn't waveny fix that with the other things a month ago?? Probably didn't expect me to get crazy with the Temporal Duplication countdown)
- Hall of Mirrors is now a toggle (and it'll be off if you already have it but it defaults to on when you buy it) (toggling costs a goat to discourage from toggling it off before buying MHP and then on again after you've bought it)
- Temporal Duplication factor negative fix, and formula fix
- Glass Storages now offer machine purchases when you have infinite (important after Molpy Down) (oops!)
- Shopping Assistant would seem to work for boosts with an alias but it wouldn't actually buy. Fixed now.
- Waveney's robotic shopper thing maybe works?

### 3.273
- Castle destruction has been completely wrong for several versions, how did no one notice until recently?

## 3.272
- Molpy Down boosts (aka prizes) were too slow to get
- Prizes group actually shows up (oops)
- Some new prizes
- Prize stats text added
- CD,SP's influence on the maximum logicat puzzle number is now multiplied by the Panther Rush level (so the 100 puzzle requirement for Shadow Dragon is less ridiculously high now)
- Improve Automata Assemble description
- Boosts and Badges with no icon of their own use the icon of the group
- Typos can be applied before a < now (rather than avoiding strings with them entirely) so it should be a bit easier to go for the badge now
- Added a way to reset mustard tools. Also mustard tools are prevented from mustarding the sand-click-dig rate
- Glass Saw was fixed but the code to unstick people stuck by the bug was in the wrong place. That's been fixed now but also a hopefully useful value for Glass Saw has been guessed so they don't have to start at 1 and click many thousands of times achieving nothing to get it back to a useful power again

### 3.2711
- Fixed Glass Saw

### 3.271
- Missed Nest condition
- Previous nerfing wasn't quite enough
- Making glass blocks now destroys the chips which subtracts from the amount of chips gained so it reports gains accurately
- Production Control is now set to its maximum if have Nope! once you buy it after Molpy Down

### 3.27
- Infinite Saw rename fix
- New mustard badge
- Fixed an infinite loop
- Added mustard
- Boosts that raise a tool's outputs based on the number you have of another tool are now capped at 8000 tools. Except Bacon.
- Added a few dragon things. And something mysterious.
- Added a few new boosts that are kinda tricky to get because they involve Molpy Down and Bag of Holding...

### 3.265
- Prevent Magic Mirror from letting you jump to where you are
- Blackprints' Has check was failing if there was no next blackprint subject
- Fixed a toolfactory mustard issue.
- Warn about the 400 goat requirement for BoH
- When constructing from blackprints, do nothing if the subject is missing (so if you sell your goats while making BoH it'll just stall rather than continue and fail)
- Free Advice shows Lucky Twin unlock progress
- Some refactoring for whether boosts are enabled, so make it easier in the future to change visual style for enabled vs disabled boosts in a universal fashion
- Discoveries and Sand Monuments now hide their Make buttons when the monument is being filled (also they refresh straight away to ensure the description redraws)
- New Dragon to ease the drudgery of mould related tasks
- Goat unlocks were broken
- Navcode bots-destroyed message lacked numeric formatting (because it used to be for 30 max)

### 3.264
- Missing parentheses in WotA

### 3.263
- So I was right when I suspected I would miss something when I copied the glass extruder downgrade code to sand refinery
- Put a lower limit on WotA

### 3.262
- Prevent mustard Flag sand rate when you have infinite waves
- Suppress SGC message if you have infinite blocks

### 3.261
- Fixed some backwards logic (dragon forge, glass saw)
- New boost had a crash bug
- Prevent blackprint construction from reporting using negative FA runs
- Prevent Glassed Lightning from having over 500 countdown (also done on upgrade)

### 3.26
- Moved logicat levels to the new system so spending/gaining them is simpler code-wise
- Waveney's latest bunch of discoveries
- Constructing from Blackprints capped at 400 FA runs until you have Automata Engineers
- Figured out and fixed Temporal Duplication: removed the 'fix temp boosts stuck at 0' code :P
- I'd forgotten that Temp Boosts mean that html can get typos in it. So now any string with a < in it won't get typo'd (fixes weirdness like stuck strikethroughs in log)
- Some Dragon Foundry and Thunderbird nerfs
- Finally implemented Shadow Dragon to take care of extra logicat puzzles you have no use for
- Bag of Holding now costs to use!!
- Fixed some silliness that was causing the wrong Blackprints message to be shown in some cases
- More infinite glass issues
- Option descriptions were refreshing whenever tools were bought, which I think was causing some weirdness (colourscheme toggle was hard to click)
- Toggling No Sell updates faves
- Some stuff to help with infinite glass mustard, including glass saw, tool factory, and refinery/chiller fixes

### 3.251
- Fixed Monty Haul Problem's Goat[s] usage
- Put in a fix to ensure you get Château d'If if you have the Unreachable? Badge (which has the side effect of giving you Château d'If back when you Molpy down, which is okay I guess)
- I had put in one too many >0 for temp boost countdowns when I fixed it before, so people with negative were still stuck negative.
- Temporal Duplication warns that it's about to run out even if the countdown is not an integer
- Infinite block production prevented from mustarding chip storage: and if you have infinite blocks it doesn't bother making "more"
- TF counts toggle button always visible in Layout mode
- In NP 2101

### 3.25
- Badge clarification (Typo Storm)
- Advanced temporal duplication now applies to normal tool purchases
- Temporal Duplication now shows the multiplication factor, and countdown is formatted a bit nicer
- Gave TD a badge too
- Refactored add/spend/has chips/blocks/goats functions to make a generic resource system, in preparation for a generic price system
- Coma and Load weren't clearing the group toggle boxes
- Sand and Castles are unlockable... for what they're worth (which is nothing)
- Reduced minimum resizable size
- Ensured spending infinite glass won't result in mustard
- Made a boost costing infinite blocks
- Added a couple new boost categories, though one is still empty
- If you want a Fave for sand or castles, you can. Dunno why you would though. They exist more for implementation reasons than to be useful
- I think there was something else but I've forgotten. Oh yeah the amount of factory automation needed for blackprint-construction now scales.
- Fixed some Tool Factory Chips mustard caused by infinite tools (lots of 0*infinity and infinity/infinity)
- Also fixed for glass furnace+blower sand usage (infinity/infinity in that case)

### 3.244
- Find+Replace in All Opened Documents: Y U FAIL?

### 3.243
- More Refresh
- Countdown code for boosts assumed countdown was an integer which would reach 0 exactly. This is no longer true for Temporal Duplication
- Toned down colours a bit
- Prevent refreshing a fave from making it sometimes draggable when it shouldn't be
- When loading a layout without faves, avoid getting stuck with just 1 fave.
- Now allow up to 40 faves.
- Temporal Duplication not available so early now

### 3.242
- Advanced Temporal Duplication wasn't actually making more duplicates
- SGC should now do Stretchable Storage stuff
- Toggling stats view redraws faves
- IE running locally thought it supported localStorage when it didn't, preventing run
- New Flux related boost
- Tool rates for sand and glass are shown with more decimal places if <10
- Refresh a lot of boosts that weren't being refreshed. (for Faves)
- Fixed a bunch of places that were still altering glass amounts directly rather than using the functions (thus not refreshing)

### 3.241
- Prevent Faves that should be hidden from becoming unhidden (just had to move a line into a different function)
- Wasn't taking Layouts from cookie when loading if localstorage available but empty: instead loaded no layout.

### 3.24
- Redundakitty chain variables were not initialised to 0: showed up as mustard on a new game.
- Detect html5localstorage
- Save game to localStorage if it's present, otherwise use cookies
- Load from localStorage if it's present, otherwise load from cookies
- Save/load layouts using localStorage
- When saving to localStorage, remove the 2 layouts limit. Also save the ID of the selected layout rather than always defaulting to the first one
- Classic was missing the autosavelayout option, so I copied it over (I said Classic would be missing new features!)
- Made Fireproof "better"
- Moved scrumptious donuts, made them seaish
- Schrödinger's Gingercat produces a relevant amount of glass rather than a negligible amount
- Ensure View pane is visible if you go to Layout after using Classic
- Favourites. Still has a few width-related glitches on boosts that lock and reunlock, but it works pretty well for most stuff.
- Un-broke classic: looks like I somehow deleted a critical line.

### 3.234
- Missed flagging some temp boosts: nav code and the glass switching statuses. (Now they should unstick if stuck)
- Wasn't saving or loading the autosavelayouts option value
- When loading in Classic, set up the correct panel visibility, so you don't get missing panels, or messy overflows as the Comic and Options and Stats and Export all try to draw at the same time
- Typos now work in Minus
- Added Beret Guy

### 3.233
- Fixed temp boosts on loading: it was using the start rather than current values of power and countdown because of another change I made to allegedly make testing easier for myself. Riiiight.
- Finished Dragon Foundry
- Ensure recovery of any stuck boosts
- Minus Sand Monument images show up

### 3.232
- Forgot to add a Refresh() method to Badges, which broke timetravel to/from NP with discoveries.
- Refresh Production Control and Automata Control when glass levels change (and PC when PC changes!)
- Some tool rate badges
- Some dragon boosts
- Light is now the default colour scheme

### 3.231
- Timetravel wasn't refreshing discoveries (i.e. the jump button)
- Memory warping has a (small) chance of temporal invasion
- Changed Dragon Wisdom again (now it lets you get Panther Poke with a higher number of remaining Caged Logicat questions, so you can store up more with Zookeeper)
- Caged Logicat shows Zookeeper progress, and updates if you're using Expando
- On the ONG, Caged Logicat puzzles only resets to 10 remaining if you have less than 10.
- Achronal Dragon only shows 1 tool at at time, with a button to advance through the tools.
- Telling boosts to redraw won't expand them if they're not already visible
- Redraw ALL the main 8 glass boosts whenever glass is added or spent

### 3.23
- Mustard sand rate turns to 0
- Notify when sand rate drops to 0
- Dragon Forge blackprint cost was showing up as half of the correct value because I forgot AC costs 2 per level
- When you have No Need to be Neat, the amout bought of tools doesn't reset, so you can see all the tools immediately, rather than possibly having a lot of a tool which isn't yet visible
- Tagged boosts don't show the tagged loot section when bought if their group section is visible
- In classic mode, the sand/castles numbers box wasn't being unhidden if you Molpy Down
- Fixed index page to show version number and correct colour scheme from your save
- Hilarious new badge by waveney
- **Only saves first two layouts** to try to help prevent cookie too long until that's fixed. You can create and export more layouts but only two will save. If you want to rely on 'temporary' then only have 1 other layout. When you save layouts there will be a warning message informing you of how many were not saved.

### 3.221
- Fixed options not refrshing on page Refresh
- Stats should update regardless of whether the stats selector panel is visible (you still need to toggle that to go in and out of stats view for boosts and tools... maybe I should make that a separate option. But not right now.)
- Prevented layout pane from trying (and failing) to redraw in classic

### 3.22
- Classic layout in classic.html
- Loot visibility in classic works as it used to (if you save, then change what loot categories are visible, then load, it returns to how it was saved)
- BTW if any panes are missing in classic you'll need to go into the regular page and toggle them to visible and save that to the first layout
- Tool Factory data replaces sand/castle counts if you have tool factory and infinite numbers. If you have some finite numbers, the Version box gets bumped

### 3.211
- Alerts pane placeholder text
- Stats wasn't refreshing stuff when hidden (I only had a function trigger on showing panels, not hide)

### 3.21
- Fixed Coma Molpy Style (oops I had just started debugging that when I got distracted by an Expando issue and forgot to fix it before 3.2)
- Reduced newpix bounce to stay in the bounds of the box
- Fixed Caged Logicat to display actual number of questions left (sorry I should have checked Waveney's code)
- Put Achronal Dragon in the correct group
- Removed borders when the layout is locked (I'll make a way to have that togglable, but not right now)
- Prevent Bag Burning from force-molpifying the stats numbers: it used to be necessary to be readable but now it isn't
- Having Temporal Rift prevents you from getting new Caged Logicat questions on the ONG
- Instead of Tool Factory ownership controlling the TF Counts Pane, it controls visibility of the button to toggle the TF Counts Pane
- When unlocks are checked the options pane is refreshed, so when a new option is unlocked it appears immediately rather than requiring the options to be opened again.
- Unlocking the Layout prevents Click-digging. (But not the other ways)
- Default layout a bit less ugly
- Added a second default layout which can be accessed via Import New and typing 'default2'
- Yes there's still more fixed to be made but I think this is good for a first batch

### 3.2
- Glass Ceilings are their own boost group
- Also a Draconic boost group (even though the dragons are currently terrible)
- Dragon unlocks were checking if the potential reward was owned rather than unlocked, which was silly.
- Dragon Changes (hopefully should make them more useful)
- NaN (mustard) Time Travel price is autocorrected to Infinity
- waveney did a bunch of stuff: fix Discov Detector for Minus, fixed jump pricing for Minus travel, Magic Mirror and Locked Vaults
- Added a new absolutely free boost because I'm so generous
- Added a badge. You probably don't want it
- Boost to start making Molpy Down a little more interesting and less painful in the later game (there will be more...)
- Fix Swim Between the Flags bug (modulus operator can have a negative result)
- Add jQuery-UI (not latest version because it has a bug with draggable stuff and the scrollbar)
- Make lots of elements draggable and some resizable
- Flatten HTML hierarchy since it's not necessary for layout now
- Options/Stats/Export can be toggled on and off independently rather than replacing each other
- Added missing linebreaks in Mould fillers
- More items can be hidden
- Moving items to the right or bottom automatically scrolls the viewport
- Default layout
- Added a pane for offsite links, copied the links from the index to it.
- Added a new link to index
- Everything but the newpix is hidden until the layout loads, so you don't see an ugly mess (especially if your browser asks confirmation before running javascript)
- Split the stats tabs into separate panels
- Button to lock/unlock the layout, it's locked by default
- When layout is unlocked, you can toggle Snap to Panes and Snap to Grid
- Buttons for managing layouts: activate, rename, clone, overwrite, export, delete.
- You can't delete the active layout
- Toggling visibility of panels immediately affects the active layout. Moving or resizing an element does not affect a layout at all.
- Overwrite will store the positions, sizes, and visibility of everything in that layout
- the Load/Save Layouts buttons store all the current layout values in cookies. (If you have moved any panes and not used Overwrite, those changes aren't saved)
- When you load layouts, the top layout is automatically activated
- By default, layouts are automatically saved when you save your game.
- There's an option to not automatically save layouts, or to save layouts when the game autosaves (it still won't automatically Overwrite current positions/sizes into a layout)
- The Autosave Option boost now unlocks after 5 saves rather than 20
- You can get back the default layout (if you want it for some reason :P) by typing the word "default" into the Import New dialog, instead of a layout code
- BTW, layouts are exported individually so you can share individual layouts as you wish. Also they're not encoded so you can easily edit them externally if you want
- When you save layouts, the current screen layout is saved as 'temporary' and added to the end of the layouts list, in case you didn't Overwrite
- Notifications are not affected by scrollbar!

### 3.19
- Glass Monuments no longer tease that there's something to get after them, because it's not available yet so implying that there is something that players can't get yet would be mean so I'm not doing that any more :P
- Split code into separate files finally!

### 3.1898
- I misplaced a <20 when I put abs() around the newpixnumber everywhere... which made the maximum JDip level 0. oops.
- Un-broke index page (oi, waveney!)

### 3.1897
- Load and Import clear the log
- Molpy Down accounts for startPower of Boosts being a function (sorry that was breaking saves)
- Buff Panther Glaze x10
- Make np-based Badges which have upgrades to be built, more obvious. (includes a fallback if you have chromatic heresy off)
- Hide glass per mNP stats if you don't have AA

### 3.1896
- rogue semicolon in the GlassChillerIncrement function

### 3.1895
- Needed more abs (forgot I was using pow in some cases)
- Safety Pumpkin's stats were out of date (now moved to Safety Goggles)
- Fixed waveney's spelling of Furnace (I've made the same typo myself a lot :P)
- Added way to get Ninja Shortcomings if it was missed before the big Ninja Stealth multipliers

### 3.1894
- Some fixes and new discoveries from waveney
- Gave the abs a workout
- Found new badge

### 3.1893
- I forgot something.
- Update the descriptions too.

### 3.1892
- Nerf Castle Crush (wondered when that would get noticed :P)
- Plug Temporal Rift hole
- Glass Monument fix (wasn't setting previewNP back to 0 in one case)
- A few new discoveries and a badge
- Fiddled with MHP a little but don't think I fixed whatever's messing up the price displace for some :(
- I forgot something.

### 3.1891
- Negative chips fix, new badge, glass production stats - waveney
- Glass production stats take Furnace Crossfeed/Multitasking into account
- New Boost for those who forget to operate their camera

### 3.189
- Free Advice conditional advice fix
- Changed Imprevious Ninja to use Ninja Forgiveness instead of a countdown timer. Also it costs 1% of your Glass Chips in storage (minimum cost is 100 chips)

### 3.1881
- Fix panther salve toggle - it wasn't generic after all.

### 3.188
- Shopping Assistant tells you when you select an item which you already bought
- Unflipped some important lines in MHP Goat

### 3.1871
- Missed a . because HAAAAAAAAANDS (this is github's fault for complicated reasons I won't get into)
- So, how about capitalising a critical new function... and then not?
- Funny how both problems were caused by me modifying waveney's code :P I guess I shouldn't.

### 3.187
- Small buff from Panther Rush to Panther Poke
- Fixed out of control MHP pricing (multiply instead of a divide)
- Waveney's stretchable glass storage (heh, I actually need that in-game right now!)
- Apostrophe missing from a discovery (waveney fixing his own problem :P)
- Redundancy Removal: All the simple toggle boosts use the same toggle function now (rather than copypaste with names changed)
- Aliased Glass Chip Storage and Glass Block Storage to GlassChips and GlassBlocks to make the code shorter
- Hall of Mirrors boost (guess what that does!)
- Prevent Hauling of fractional castles
- Ensure Glass Saw can't leave your chip balance negative

### 3.1863
- Wasn't using the alias for the cards everywhere (ACTUALLY fixes gold and silver card)

### 3.1862
- Alias, not Aka! (fixes gold and silver card)

### 3.1861
- Math, it needs a capital letter!

### 3.186
- Such Glass fix - waveney
- Seaish Upgrade 100% sand usage prevented - waveney
- Goat badge was mispelled
- Renamed MHP upon TFMurphy's suggestion
- Fixed goat icon
- Price Protection wait time is configurable
- Keygrinder icon fix
- Dragon Wisdom typo fix (thanks again TFMurphy)
- Improved discounts from ASHF are now boosts that are available from the Department after you earn the corresponding badges

### 3.185
- I can't even rename a variable without messing up, sorry waveney
- messed around with some boost unlock conditions
- new badge

### 3.184
- More accurately determine user activity and bounce rate (don't count first 5 badges, and automatic stuff isn't counted as interaction so idlers aren't counted as active)
- Track buy/sell of tools
- Track upgrade/downgrade boosts
- Free Advice tells you how to get Sand/Castles to Glass, once you get Tool Factory
- Renamed anything with threshhold to threshold
- Shoutout to bay12forums: Just noticed some active visitors from there. I like to read stuff there on occasion (Battlefailed Saga!)
- Line on AA description about how it stops glass-gain messages since that would be spammy otherwise
- Removed Double or Nothing forever
- waveney's thing for supressing tiny glass notifications (changed to use a variable rather than literals, so it's easier to tweak if necessary)
- Didn't upgrade the PC upgrade limit because I don't want to.

### 3.183
- Making the Discoveries category use the appropriate icon slipped my mind, again
- Missing icon
- Inverted statements
- Recycling Beanies hint if you don't have enough BBs

### 3.182
- Typo fixes from waveney (SGR, MMolpy)
- Badge by waveney
- Got lost reading TVTropes, sorry. Guess I better push these bugfixes, but first:
- When you have Panther Glaze, the descriptions of the boosts it modified show how many glass chips they produce

### 3.181
- Factory Automation description changed to stop people asking how to upgrade it again after they temporal rift :P
- Fixed some transparency stupidity (btw yes if there's a lot of notifications on the screen, some will not go transparent at all until the others have vanished)
- Added an explanatory note to Bag Burning so people don't think it's broken and "fix" it with the console. *ahem*

### 3.18
- Lots more icons from BlitzGirl
- Temporal Rift fixed for infinite castles, like Molpy Down
- New Ninja boost
- Nerfed Fireproof a bit
- Some Not Lucky boost description changes (regarding not costing glass if you have infinite castles)
- Read TVTropes a lot
- Glass Tools now show glass stats instead of sand/castle stats when appropriate
- When building 0 castles, a castle multiplier of infinity (from flux surge?) will now result in 0 rather than mustard (NaN)

### 3.17
- Messed with chance of intruder bots in a certain circumstance...
- When loading, if highest NP visited is missing, using the current NewPix number
- When you have Bacon, Bag Burning is locked if you pass its threshold, so millions of bags are not continually burned pointlessly forever
- A boost for NewPixBots, related to the above item.
- If a spendable value gets to negative (i.e. number of glass blocks), you can now still buy stuff that costs 0 of that.
- This particularly fixes weirdness such as ASHF landing in the shop rather than in loot (because they still count as being bought for 0 because reasons)
- Fixed Furnace Multitasking description (thanks for pointing that out eldercain)
- Fixed a Logicat power bug in Dragon Forge (I can hardly believe I wrote that sentence and it means something)
- Finished the other new dragon
- Added some redundancy (it's been a while)

### 3.16
- New Boost Icons from BlitzGirl! (mostly tagged boosts)
- Zero more potential mustard (NaN) when loading
- Beachball Boost doesn't show ninja warning after you've ninja'd
- Redunception doesn't notify if Expando is active
- Automata Control optimised when you have all glass tools: no need to make tools that are about to be spent
- Sand particles don't need transparency
- Don't mess with transparency of more than 8 notifications
- Fixed a discovery on wrong NP
- When you Molpy Down with infinite castles, totalCastlesDown is set to Number.MAX_VALUE (previously it was unchanged if infinite castles) thanks EPSILON of DashNet IRC
- Chromatic Heresy is related to 'hue', right? ;)
- Formatting of negative decimal numbers was horribly broken. Not that there should be negative numbers, but now if there is, they're the right negative numbers!
- Remove spaces from tool icon IDs
- New Tool Icons also from BlitzGirl! Yay!!
- Constructing from Blackprints now does nothing if you somehow end up with less pages then needed
- Two new Tool boosts. (What is Friendship? Why does the hotdog not have any wolpeys?)
- Another Dragon, plus one not finished yet

### 3.153
- Discovery Detector messages go to log
- Typo in Discovery Detector (yay not mine)
- I forgot to wrap the Sand Monument images in the new URL function I'd extracted when attempting to do preloading
- So now Sand Monument images will actually appear
- Another DD change by waveney
- Stats shows partial blackprints, also by waveney (wish I'd thought of that! Well I hope I would have, but it's a moot point question now :P)
- Forgot to change a number when I supposedly made Mysterious Representations activate at lower AC levels, making it go backwards
- I updated Google Chrome and now I can't look at the console and sources at the same time. (Just felt like complaining)
- Panther Rush checks that you have the required logicat levels when buying it
- Panther Rush asks the user if you really want to spend the logicat levels before using them
- Panther Rush reunlocks after usage if you have enough Logicat levels for its next (or current, if you declined to buy it) level
- That's because the confirmation actually happens after buying so it has to lock and unlock to ensure the number of boosts owned comes out right
- Assuming it does come out right (let me know if you see any wonky numbers: someone reported an issue with negative boosts owned a while back and though I haven't bene able to reproduce it, that doesn't mean it can't happen in some circumstances)
- Rambled in changelog. I'm surprised I managed to avoid doing that for so long. I tend to ramble. Especially when... nevermind

### 3.152
- Allowed much higher production control

### 3.151
- Missed buckets in my phone-only mustard sand-tool-rate fix, which cost me a factory automation run because I had no sand unexpectedly

### 3.15
- Bunch of numbers in the save were being parsed as ints instead of floats, leading to problems now that the numbers are large enough
- In particular, glass storage sizes, but temporal duplicates were now able to go wrong too, and the number of active bots, and a few other things
- Thanks for doing that for me waveney :D

### 3.143
- Okay so the problem was that on my phone, javascript likes to think that Math.pow() should return 0 instead of Infinity for very large exponents
- And it was fine for castle tools since I was shortcutting their prices to infinity already. So now I'm doing that for sand tools also

### 3.142
- Messing with order of multiplication of sand tool rate multipliers, returning early for infinities, might fix the NaNs that only show up on my phone

### 3.1416
- Handle weird case where Constructing from Blackprints is constructing nothing (I don't even)
- Locked Crate reward no longer uses a loop to expand block storage. That was stupid
- Negative message on Discovery Detector (thanks waveney)
- New dragon
- Finally remembered to put jQuery.js back on the index page

### 3.1415
- Disabled the jQuery preload of next newpix because it was not working and was spitting out errors for some
- faster seaish (big) upgrades of Sand Purifier and Glass Extruder (waveney)
- Redundatracking, and some tracking bugfixes
- Beachball boost fix: ensure change to blue is after bots have activated
- Sawtracking

### 3.141
- Tracking update: convert integers to strings
- Less hovering

### 3.14
- Automata Control next upgrade price shown
- Strikethrough on unaffordable stuff
- Waveney's discovery detector
- Finally fixed tool price formatting so that NewPixBot costs 1 Castle not 1 Castles
- Prices are divs not spans so they don't start on the same line as the buy link
- Some Google Analytics stuff
- Achronal Dragon to track and destroy temporal duplicates (if you want to)
- Add/Spend Glass Chips now makes the following descriptions update (per mNP): Glass Chip Storage, Sand Refinery, Glass Extruder
- Add/Spend Glass Blocks now makes the following descriptions update (per mNP): Glass Block Storage, Sand Purifier, Glass Chiller
- Cold Mould boost to pause Mould activities
- Price Protection boost to prevent accidental buys after ASHF ends (is togglable)
- Added a bunch of tool chip rate badges
- Preloading the next newpix 2mNP before the ONG (except it isn't working yet, I think)
- Changed Beachball boost to warn 2mNP before ONG rather than 1 (because of the above)

### 3.13
- Now you can call Molpify like this: Molpify(someNumber, decimalPlaces,2) and it won't apply all the letter prefix things, regardless of your game's scientific notation setting
- The 'enough chips for making blocks' check was backwards all along
- Changed Broken Rung condition: for instance while 6000 bags bought will make LaPetite visible (unchanged), 6000 bags *owned* is needed for 0 LaPetite to affect Broken Rung
- New Badge for beginners to teach about waiting for the ONG
- Also extended the description of Castle Price Rollback badge
- Added google analytics to track pageviews.  Let me know if that is a terrible idea
- BKJ power level moved to display on stats rather than description
- Also improved BFJ description/stats a bit
- Nerfed Blast Furnace a little pre-BFJ (was limited to total castles built /2, now it's /3) but buffed it with BFJ (was /10, now /5)
- So Blast Furnace with BFJ (and Blitzing) is still more limited by the total castles built than otherwise, but if your total castles built is huge then it's better than without (i.e if you've used Molpy Down you can potentially catch back up faster)
- Blast Furnace with Blitzing without BFJ is twice as effective as without Blitzing, which is unchanged from before but I just thought I'd mention it.
- Fixed Tool Factory giving things it shouldn't: I forgot to copy a condition

### 3.12
- I removed the molpies and grapevines from the wrong place
- The previous Tool Factory changes broke Tool Factory (and all your tools) if you didn't have Tool Factory
- If you don't have an earlier save, sorry but your tools are gone and I can't get them back. If you remember how many you had, feel free to edit them back in
- Also suggest suitable punishments for me
- So yeah I should test what happens if you *don't* have features that I'm changing as well as if you do.

### 3.11
- Panther Rush description missing word
- Ensure WWB/RB's unlock Boosts will unlock if you're already eligible for them.
- Don't show trade/hint for WWB when infinite factor
- Remove WWB from tagged items when infinite factor
- Adjust Knitted Beanies and Space Elevator prices
- Wasn't a way to see BKJ! power level
- Locking glass ceilings now distributes Tool Factory's production over the remaining glass tools
- i.e. if you have PC=1 and lock 6 of 12 glass ceilings, it'll make 2 of the remaining 6 tools per mNP (assuming you can afford it!)
- or if you lock 11 you'll get 12x the 1 you didn't lock
- Upgrading to new version now says 'upgrading to new version instead of:
- *Molpy, molpy, molpy, molpy*
- *Molpy, molpy, molpy, molpy*
- *Molpy, molpy, molpy, molpy*
- *Grapevine, grapevine*
- More PC multiupgrades: now in a for loop!
- Changed Tool Factory (other than the simple can afford to buy everything case) to bulk buy the largest number of tools it can buy the same amount of, then buy 1 of anything leftover
- Bag burning should power up twice as fast, also removed the random burning of single bags.
- Longer description for Bag Burning
- Some Tool rate badges
- DestroyPhase function no longer loops once per castle tool owned (which is kinda slow when you get millions), instead uses division :P
- A single over nine thousand joke wasn't enough. Especially since I made it months ago.

### 3.1
- Fixed index to accept title change
- Panther Rush description improved so players don't expect to see it in their Loot
- Fixed castle display so it shows "1 castle" for that first castle rather than "1 castles"
- Molpify Ninja Stealth Build amount
- Truncate scientific notation numbers to 6 decimal places
- Boots typo
- Coloured border was not removed when loading a save with Beachball boost disabled
- Fixed another Beach CSS problem: turned out all the recent issues there were caused by using .background instead of .backgroundImage
- A couple new Glass Tool boosts

### 3.09
- If Locked Crate prices is mustarded, it becomes free (apart from the glass). Sorry I thought that couldn't happen in the wild.
- And a Badge because why not?
- More of Waveney's Discoveries
- Removed all the upgrade code for versions less than 2.1 because I doubt anyone is running those. If so, let me know and don't upgrade until I put it back.
- Showing full numbers in scientific notation instead of the shortened numbers is now a separate option rather than based on being in stats view
- Toggling Stats wasn't redrawing Badges
- Added Mushrooms as a counterpart to Badgers

### 3.08
- Mys*t*erious typo fixed
- Unneeded Factory Automation Upgraded message removed from Ninja Climber
- Mysterious Representations now works from AC level 15 (Zookeeper still works from 21), updated descriptions accordingly
- Blast Furnace doesn't do any blastfurnacing if you have infinite castles (doesn't effect crossfeed/multitasking)
- Keygrinder's check for key availability now doesn't need to have a logicat reward to have run first
- Spent a while reading some /vg/ igg threads which showed up when I googled VITSSÅGEN. Very amuse!
- Found a bunch of stuff that needs fixing, thanks /vg/ (lulz typo, I just saw someone pointing that out... sigh)
- Noticed that VITSSÅGEN, JA!'s description didn't mention that it gives castles every 100 clicks, since that was originally a totally unimportant fringe benefit
- VJ and Panther Salve also didn't mention that they unlock other boosts with use.
- Phonesaw also didn't say what it does, added that to its stats.
- Fixed 'activation level': meant 'automation level', duh.
- Clear target answer after completing a logicat question
- 50 Glass Block cost for Second Chance is not applied until you click the second answer
- Instructions on how to use your leopard
- Prevent Tool Factory Load Letter (and subsequent) if you don't have Tool Factory
- Added Bacon to Blackprints build list for people who managed to get infinite sand rate without it and don't want to wait (yes I wrote dip before, that was wrong)
- Bigger load sizes for TFLL
- With Booster Glass, show +numbers on click (if the click-numbers option is enabled)
- Fixed stupid CSS weirdness preventing the resizing of Colpix

### 3.07
- Moved AdjustFade so it's accessible to the index page (so the version number shows up again)
- Changed Locksmith to Mysterious Representations, which produces pages directly.
- Removed Zookeeper notification (just wait for Caged Logicat to show up)
- Track redundakitty chains, added a badge and a stat
- Actually fixed Overcompensating
- If Panther Rush is stuck in Loot from earlier bug, run its buy function to fix

### 3.06
- On buying a Crate Key, it will try to buy Locked Crate before using up the key making the Crate cheaper (so the key will be used to remove a lock, when it previously it was wasted)
- Added stats view for Trebuchet Pong, Grapevine, Ch*rpies, and Facebugs
- Beachball
- Exponential boosts now say "boosts by x% cumulatively per thing" to distinguish them from linear increases
- Wasn't Molpifying the division numbers for sand purifier or glass extruder

### 3.05
- Fixed Expando/Glass Monument interaction

### 3.04
- Prevent Locksmith from awarding ASHF when you already have it
- Overcompensating's buff wasn't applied to saves which already had Overcompensating owned
- Fix panther rush on-buy crash (fortunately it was in calculating the levels so it didn't waste any levels)
- Nerfed Locksmith a bit (even though it wasn't any more powerful than AA was previously if you knew how to leverage it...)
- Crate key message improved and not shown if from locksmith
- Boost unlock/lock/describe messages supressed from locksmith/zookeeper: just 1 message to show that one/both activated
- Disabled Expando because it's causing problems and I don't have time to fix it properly right now, sorry
- Glass Saw is a toggle now
- Molpy Down refreshes the Options

### 3.03
- Changed all occurrences of "% of sand dug" to "% of sand dig rate", so glass-production costs are clearer (thanks Vidyogamasta for pointing that out... 2 weeks ago)
- Waveney's improvement to Glass Saw: instead of leaving 5% of Block Storage empty, it leaves space equal to 10mNP worth of Automata Assemble's Factory Automation (so it'll still fill block storage if you don't have AA going)
- Automata Assemble now uses same function for running FA in all cases
- Automata Assemble description updated to show that it only activates Blast Furnace (and subsequent functions based on crossfeed/multitasking)
- New boosts to add ability for AA to do Blackprints/Moulds work, and produce Keys and Panther Poke
- Monument Time Travel doesn't use any castles now but it costs more chips. (based on the square of the distance, so multiple short hops are cheaper than a long jump)
- Destruction verb for NewPixBots because their destruction counter is used in Judgement Dip
- Furnace Multitasking was not locking in shortpix, which lead to weirdness with AA because it quickly used up all your (well, my) Chips making Blocks
- Sand Monuments show a thumbnail of their NP and Glass Monuments change the main image to their image
- SGC added. No that does not stand for Seaish Glass Chips
- Seaish Glass Chips description improved to explain what it doesn't do
- A couple of monument related boosts (untested...)
- Seaish upgrade for Glass Chiller is limited so it won't use more chips than the Glass Furnace is making
- *The Sea is Big*

### 3.021
- Was missing a return so the castle tool price calc was still horribly slow

### 3.02
- Added Upgrade x10 button to Production Control
- Downgrade buttons on Production Control, Automata Control, Sand Refinery, and Glass Chiller are all hidden by No Sell
- But did anyone ever use those apart from accidentally?
- Fix stupid typo (pricePrice) which was messing up the shortcut calculation of infinte castle tool prices and therefore causing higher load times the more castle tools you/I have
- If no Blackprint-construction remains, the Blackprints-needed stat shows the amount needed for Automata Control
- Panther Rush now uses up 5 less Logicat levels, but still unlocks at the same point, meaning when you buy it you can't have less than 5 levels left

### 3.01
- Shopping donkey doesn't buy if no item (i.e. prevent crash.)
- Logicat's "correct answers needed" display now accounts for Panther Rush
- Bunch of new NP-based badges, by waveney (cos I was taking too long getting around to adding them)
- Fixxed some typoes

- Fixed RRR parentheses mustard

- Another Not Lucky boost and buffed the previous 2
- Now they're probably overpowered. I dunno. I'm 2 nopix late for coma.
